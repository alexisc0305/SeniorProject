## General Information
The CHC model is a system that performs multi-class classification on images via deep learning and
a convolutional neural network (VGG Model). The CHC Model uses multi-class classification to identify if an
image has no hair or one of the ten hair types (i.e., 1, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B, 4C). A user interface
was developed to allow users to upload an image of their hair. The user image will be tested against the trained 
CHC Model, producing a hair type prediction. The results of the trained CHC Model is visualized to the user via 
user interface.


## Required Software Dependencies
- Python (3.7 version or later)
- Visual Studio (VS) Code
